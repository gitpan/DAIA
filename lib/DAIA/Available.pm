DAIA::Available - Information about a service that is currently unavailable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is derived from L<DAIA::Availability> - see that class for details.
In addition there is the property C<delay> that holds an XML Schema duration
value or the special value C<unknown>.  Obviously the C<status> property of
a C<DAIA::Unavailable> object is always C<1>.

An array reference with limitations (L<DAIA::Limitation> objects).

=item message

An array reference with L<DAIA::Message> objects about this specific service.

=item delay

A delay as duration string (XML Schema C<xs:duration>). To get the
delay as L<DateTime::Duration> object, use the C<parse_duration>
function that can be exported on request.
